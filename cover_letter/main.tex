I have recently learned about the new open vacancy related to the positions of \textbf{Position you are applying} in \textbf{company name}
and I am writing to state my interest on it. For completion, I attach my resume to this cover letter.

I am currently attending the last year of my PhD in mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Calabria and I expect to finish by October 2017. My PhD programme has been mainly focused on scientific computation for massively parallel architectures for macroscopic natural phenomena simulation. I also have an MSc in Computer Science (\textit{cum laude}) from the University of Calabria, focused on theoretical computer science, AI, answer set programming and parallel computing.

What attracts me to \textbf{company name} is my interest in dealing with innovative software systems. As an ambitious
PhD student I wish to work for a leading international company, developing innovative and advanced products.
After having challenged myself in different multicultural and professional backgrounds, by working on my MSc Thesis (for 8 months) at University of Plymouth, and by being accepted as Research Visiting student at  University of Edinburgh (10 months) and at University of Warwick (6 weeks), I am keen to work for a global, international-minded, company and be part of a proactive and dynamic attitude. Contributing to investigating and developing new technologies for future products, excites me and
I feel naturally driven to this type of work.

In addition to scientific computing, during my studies I have also been interested in how the exa-scale simulation data paradigm could be interactively visualized and analyzed. This has been deepened with an enriching experience at University of Edinburgh on the \textit{VELaSSCO} EU project and on functional programming.
My willingness and curiosity to learn, with my determination to pursue an objective with resilience, have always driven me through my studies and especially my PhD, where I have also learnt to take ownership of my tasks, while working and communicating effectively in a project-team with international partners. This mindset and the different
topics I have focused on so far, have given me the right adaptability and multidisciplinary background to fit in a company with an international outlook.

I have attached my CV for your consideration and hope you will consider my application. I am available
for interview to discuss my application further at your convenience and look forward to hearing from you.

\aboutme{I am a curious and passionate software engineer and my interests include, but are not limited to, C++, parallel programming and GPGPU. I am an active \href{https://stackoverflow.com/users/1417063/davide-spataro}{StackOverflow \faStackOverflow} user, avid reader of technical and scientific books and articles but I also enjoy participating in competitive programming competitions or writing blog articles. I am passionate about classical music, photography and investing. When I am not coding I am most likely paddling in the Mediterranean sea or on a race bike.I feel naturally inclined to working in a team, but I am also capable of  tackling and solving complex problems autonomously. I like to be surrounded by people I can learn from. I drink a lot of coffee \faCoffee. }%About me section

%\section{Short Bio}
%He was born the $14^{th}$ February 1990 and grew up in Nicotera, a small city in Southern Italy. He attended the secondary school focusing on humanities and in 2008 he moved to Cosenza, where he studied first and then collaborated with researchers of the Department of Computer Science on the simulation of complex natural systems. His research interests revolve around the topics of `Parallel Computing' and  HPC. Since 2018 he lives in Eindhoven, working as Software Engineer at ASML for photo-lithography systems. He studied piano and music since he was eight for ten years, long enough to make him addicted to classical and jazz music.

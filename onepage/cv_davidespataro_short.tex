\aboutme{ \emergencystretch 3em I am a curious and passionate software engineer and my interests include, but are not limited to, C++, parallel programming and GPGPU. I am an active \href{https://stackoverflow.com/users/1417063/davide-spataro}{StackOverflow \faStackOverflow} user, avid reader of technical and scientific books and articles. Participating in competitive programming competitions and writing blog articles on C++ and algorithms is how I keep challenging myself daily. 
I feel naturally inclined to work in a team, but I am also capable of  tackling and solving complex problems autonomously. 
In addition, I am always looking for people and experiences from which I can learn and improve.
I was born and raised in Nicotera, Southern Italy. At the age of 12 I started programming and studied piano and music for 10 years until at the age of 18 I decided to fully concentrate on Computer Science. Long enough to make me addicted to classical and jazz music. Besides that, I am passionate about photography and investing. When I am not coding I am most likely either paddling in the Mediterranean sea, lifting weights in the gym or fighting gravity on a race bike. I drink a lot of coffee \faCoffee.

%\section{Short Bio}
%He was born the $14^{th}$ February 1990 and grew up in Nicotera, a small city in Southern Italy. He attended the secondary school focusing on humanities and in 2008 he moved to Cosenza, where he studied first and then collaborated with researchers of the Department of Computer Science on the simulation of complex natural systems. His research interests revolve around the topics of `Parallel Computing' and  HPC. Since 2018 he lives in Eindhoven, working as Software Engineer at ASML for photo-lithography systems. He studied piano and music since he was eight for ten years, long enough to make him addicted to classical and jazz music.
